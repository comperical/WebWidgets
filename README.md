# WebWidgets

Public gallery code and scripts for WebWidgets system. 

### Widget Gallery

This is a gallery of widgets that I have chosen as examples for public demonstration.
Most of them are quite simple, the main exceptions are the `chinese` tools 
	(this is actually a collection of tools) 
	and the `workout` widget, which has some complex logic.
	

The gallery demonstrates several of the following points:

1. Loading the data from the SQLite DB for the widget
1. Including the Authentication and Asset tags
1. Standard create/update/delete operations on records
1. Composition of HTML strings with ES 6 String interpolation.


### Python Scripts

This directory contains Python scripts that can be used to grab widget DB files from the server (`DbGrabber.py`),
	and to upload either DB files or widget code files.
Important: you are expected to maintain, backup, and/or source control your widget code!
The service will backup the DB files, but not the source code. 

Usage:

```


```
